# Bicycle Turn Signal 
Since I spend most of my work day and free-time sitting on my butt I try to make up for it by riding my bike instead of driving whenever possible. Riding on the streets, especially around campus, can be a little dangerous from time to time so I decided to add a smidge of extra visibility.
