# Bicycle Turn Signal 
Since I spend most of my work day and free-time sitting on my butt I try to make up for it by riding my bike instead of driving whenever possible. Riding on the streets, especially around campus, can be a little dangerous from time to time so I decided to add a smidge of extra visibility.


# Parts
- WS2812B addressable RGB LED strip
- Arduino Pro Mini 5V
- USB battery pack
- USB cable
- Bicycle (duh)

# Status
The first hardware prototype is up and running.
- The turn signal buttons need replaced with something more tactile
- The turn signal indicator needs to be more obvious
- ~~Turning on the left signal should disable the right one and vice versa~~
- ~~Blinking speed needs to be slowed (250ms to 333ms?)~~
